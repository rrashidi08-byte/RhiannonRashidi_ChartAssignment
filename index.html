<p>Susan J. Popkin is a fellow at the Urban Institue and leads its Future of Pupblic Housing Initiative. She said that a lack of funding coming into the Housing Authority from the federal government is to blame. "What you're dealing with in New York, we're in a situation where the funding for public housing is continuing to get squeezed. This is not the 1990s where there was the big infusion of cash so it's really important to have sustained civic engagement and sustained support," she said.

<p>Community members say they have to be organized and on top of the housing authority if they want any work to be done on their units. Susan Perez, the newly re-elected tenant association president at the John Hayes Holmes Towers says one of her priotities is to advocate for residents to get their maintenance requests completed in a timely manner.</p>
